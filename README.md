* In server.js file 
   <ul> 
  <li> require all the nmp packages
  <li> Setting up port and requiring models for syncing
  <li> Creating express app and configuring middleware needed for authentication.
  <li> requiring routes from the routes folder
  <li> Syncing our database and logging a message to the user upon success
  <li> listen to port to kicks up the whole thing and starts the server
  </li>
  </ul>

  </ul>


* In config folder

## Code Snippet
Install npm package 
npm install express

$ npm install express

Required variables 
``` Javascript

```

Sets up the Express app to handle data parsing
``` Javascript

```

Set routes to handle when user "visit" the page 
``` Javascript

```

Serialize takes your basic data structure and flatten it out into a string, by reading top to bottom. Now you have one big ass string. want to duplicate or extract, deserialize take that string and construct it again, make back into an object
``` Javascript 
passport.serializeUser(function(user, cb) {
 cb(null, user);
});
passport.deserializeUser(function(obj, cb) {
 cb(null, obj);}); 
module.exports = passport;
```
